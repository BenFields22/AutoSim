# Auto Simulation Analysis Engine (ASAE)
This application allows a user to create a discrete event simulation using a text-based abstraction. A single text file is used to define the model using a standard format. The text based abstraction of the model is then read into the simulation engine to automatically create the simulation model. Once constructed, the simulation executes and produces event data for use in process analysis and discovery. The recorded data is then scanned by a DataCrawler to extract useful information such as transition frequencies, transition times, buffer locations, utilized buffer capacity, average throughput and more.

A Web based tool has been created to help in the building of ASAE model definitions [Here](http://35.196.149.4/)
